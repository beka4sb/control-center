# Running a Bug Bash

## Why do I need to run a bug bash?
Bug bashes are important for two main reasons:

- Help identify bugs before it is released to users
- Ensure PM, UX and Eng are on the same page

## Methodology

1. Make a copy and complete [go/testing-notes-template](http://go/testing-notes-template), the new document should live in the same [Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TQZM2lntOJ8l1KbSN3m7R6_D2qKOSISE?usp=sharing)
2. Create a new Section for your feature in [go/cc-bugs-asana](http://go/cc-bugs-asana), to track bugs found during the session.
3. Schedule the bug bash with PM, UX and Eng, recommended time is 30 min.
4. After the bug bash, consolidate and triage bugs found
