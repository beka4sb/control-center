# Technical Documentation

The Control Center platform is a React Single Page Application, the code base lives in [go/cc](https://go/cc). For instructions on how to build and run the Control Center platform, refer to the [README](https://github.com/sandbox-quantum/chungus/blob/main/saq/pqc/control-center/README.md).

Currently we are migrating pages from the legacy Cryptosense front-end platform (Flask App), to the Control Center React SPA. For more information on the migration plan and trade offs see the [Foundation](foundation.md) page.

For development guidelines, refer to the [development guidelines](../development-guidelines.md) page.
